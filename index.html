<h1> Hello World!</h1> 
<h2>~ so cliched but had to be done... </h2>
<p> Welcome to my first little GitHub project. This is a WIP, hence the very basic nature of this site. Hopefully it will evolve and over time to something that doesn't resemble a website circa 1999. </p>
<p>Currently I am learning from <a href=="https://www.freecodecamp.org">Free Code Camp.</a></p>
<p> A great resourceful website, highly recommended. I am currently completing the tutorials and making notes. I remember a lot of the basics that are covered in the first section on HTML and CSS which I learnt at Uni. I will put them into practice in this test piece. My learning style is through experience, putting into practice what I learn.</p>
<p>My objectives are: <ul>
		<li>Become a proficient web developer</li>
		<li>Create apps to share with the world</li>
		<li>Help people in some way to improve thier lives</li>
		<li>Get hired by an amazing company as a Web Developer</li>
		<li>Learn to code every day</li></ul></p>
<p>My motivation is: <ul>
	<li>Love to learn</li>
	<li>Code satisfaction - when it works!</li>
	<li>A huge sense of achievement in figuring out why it didn't work</li>
	<li>Very proud feeling when I created my first portfolio site</li></ul></p>
<p>Why I think I would make a great Web Developer: <ul>
	<li>I love problem solving</li>
	<li>Creative-all-rounder</li>
	<li>Quick to learn</li>
	<li>Lots of ideas for powerful apps</li>
	<li>Secretly a massive Geek</li>
	<li>I get lost for hours learning and writing code</li>
	<li>Passionate about technology and the magic that powers it</li></ul></p>
	<p>Ideas for Personal Projects<ol>
		<li>Portfolio website in a gallery style</li>
		<li>Oracle card app</li>
		<li>Life coaching app</li></ol></p>
