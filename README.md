# test
First site

Hello fellow Gits

The intention for this test site; a place to practice the code I can remember and all the new information I learn along the way.

I am currently working my way through FreeCodeCamp.org with the dream to create and share all the apps I have wanted to make for a long time. 

Potenitally get a job as a front end developer, or freelance, creating and making magic! I had forgotten how much I love to code, it is so creative and I can feel new parts of my brain waking up with the limitless possibilities.
